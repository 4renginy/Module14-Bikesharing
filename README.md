# Module14-Bikesharing

Background;

Last summer my friend Kate and I took a trip to New York City. We had have visited many monuments,parks, rode around the city, and talked to people it was a blast. After the trip when we looked back we realized that the bike trips contributed to that blast great deal. 

This is how; 

First of all we were out in the open so able to see everything, 
We did nto have to waist time in traffic, able to stop anytime we wanted and enjoy the scenery
Being out in the open also gave us chance to interect with New Yorkers.
We are able to take much more pictures with more details.

This gave us an idea why dont we do the same in our city Des Montes, Iowa.

Purpose;
Starting a business great deal of challange by itself in addition to that something with no backround knowledge makes it harder. So we decided to collect data from Citibike bikeshare and analyse it (https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data). As data point we choose August2019

Tools and methods
We have downloaded the data  as csv file however when we opened the file we realized that some data needs converstion, using python in JupyterNotebook we have changed the time format and uploaded the newly created csv file to Tableau.
Tablau is a data analyssis and visualization tool that is widely used in todays professional world. It helps us to share our story clearly with non-technical stakeholders.
Here are some of our findings.



1- We started with figuring out how many rides there werein 2019 August;

2-Then we wanted to figure out user profiles by gender and by rider type. This gave us the target porfiles. For example overall male riders doing more than twice the business then females and non-disclosed people. We can pormote more adds in women sport magazines.
